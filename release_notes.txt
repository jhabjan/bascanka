v.1.0.4.		2026-02-21
--------------------------
- fixed a bug where typing during a box (column) selection would produce corrupted text after the first few characters.
- fixed word wrap cut-off issue where characters on the right edge were clipped due to the text padding not being accounted for in wrap column calculations.
- fixed word wrap cursor navigation: arrow keys now move by visual wrap rows instead of jumping entire document lines when word wrap is enabled.
- fixed a bug where custom highlighting profiles assigned via Language > Custom Highlighting were not restored when reopening the application.
- word wrap is now saved per tab, so each document remembers its own setting across restarts and crashes, with new documents defaulting to the last-used state.
- open recent files menu now displays recent files in a cleaner two-column format.
- added move up and move down buttons for reordering custom highlighting profiles.
- fixed CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) characters overlapping in the embedded terminal by correctly treating fullwidth characters as double-width cells.
- languages menu is now sorted ascending.
- fixed the Go To Line dialog so buttons are no longer clipped outside the window and the dialog now respects the active editor theme.

v.1.0.3.		2026-02-18
--------------------------
- implemented embedded terminal (cmd.exe) to the bottom panel using the Windows ConPTY API.
- added close/crash unsaved changes recovery with periodic automatic back-ups to "%AppData%\Bascanka\recovery" - small/untitled files are backed up in full size as UTF-8, while large memory-mapped files use efficient binary delta/changes-only save format.
- fixed emoji and special character rendering, cursor positioning, selection, and caret navigation - including surrogate pairs, ZWJ sequences and variation selectors.
- lines containing wide or special characters are now rendered character-by-character to prevent GDI font fallback from causing cursor drift.
- improved Unicode character support.
- implemented a pending-delta mechanism for the line offset cache — consecutive same-line edits accumulate a virtual shift in O(1) instead of triggering an O(N) full-document rescan.
- added double-click on empty tab bar area to create a new untitled document.
- added tabbed bottom panel - Find Results and Terminal now share a tabbed bottom panel.
- fixed search history not being saved correctly.
- added Modern Windows Context Menu registration from Settings ("Edit with Bascanka"), with automatic sparse package and COM shell extension setup.
- only one Bascanka instance now runs at a time - opening files while it's running forwards them to the existing window via named pipes.

v.1.0.2.		2026-02-15
--------------------------
- added CJK / Unicode Character Support - Fixed cursor positioning for CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) and other fullwidth characters. The caret, selection highlights, search highlights, and all   other visual elements now align correctly with double-width characters.
- added GB2312 encoding and support for detecting GB2312 when opening files.
- added the ability to compare opened tabs text via the tab right-click context menu.
- added a per-tab progress bar when saving large files, allowing users to continue working on other tabs while a file is being saved.
- added system theme detection feature.
- added Chinese UI localization.
- added Serbian (Cyrillic) UI localization.
- fixed arrow key navigation to skip over surrogate pairs as a single unit instead of requiring two key presses per supplementary character.
- fixed box/column selection losing column mode when starting with Delete or Backspace, so it now stays in column mode for continued editing.
- fixed performance issue when editing large files and jumping + making changes between beginning and end of the file.
- extended the About window to include contributors and release notes.
